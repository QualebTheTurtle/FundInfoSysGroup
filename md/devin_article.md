Response: That Time Bill Gates and Steve Jobs Argued about the Future of Computers
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The article explores the different views Bill Gates and Steve Jobs had for handling the Computer. 

For Bill the computer was a way of developing his software in a way that was not just methodical, but also direct, each step building on the business of the computer while growing with the business. Steve on the other hand wanted to build a computer for the people. By building up the idea  of the personal computer, Jobs was able to market computers direct to the individual.

Today, Windows PC is the stronger contender in the computer market largly due to businesses utilyzing computers more often than the individual. However, with the invention of smart phones, Apple has begun to grow on the market. Both businesses have been extremely successful, but for different reasons and at different times each working with their specific vision of the computer. 

In the future I see Windows still leading PC and home desktops sales. Windows has not only capitalized on the function of the GUI that, is not only easy to navigate but personalizable, all in a package that is significantly cheaper than MAC.
